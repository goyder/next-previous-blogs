# Structures

The broad idea is that we'll break this down into a series of smaller articles.

My previous articles were around 2000 words, then 3000 words, then 4000 words. The intent is to avoid this kind of shenanigans.

We want each to be about 600-800 words, with reasonable numbers of images, and good amounts of understandable content. 

## Article content 

### Things it is

Each article should have:

* A clear purpose and sub-section
* A section exploring the trials and tribulations of the particular subsection
* Lots of links and steps out to other content 
* A summary to relevant information on where to get started and go further
* Things I wish I'd explored further

Each article should be relatively stand-alone. At least enough that I don't need to do aggressive recaps at the start of each article.

## Things it's not

I don't think this needs to be:

* A down-and-dirty technical explanation.
    * In places, I'm going to need to explain some technical concepts in greater detail. In these instances, I need to explain only the bare minimum required to go further. 
    * Perhaps I can highlight that there are plenty of things to dive further into for future reference.
* A full history of the NeXT ecosystem.
    * We can skirt over a lot of topics here.

In most things, we should endeavour to explore even complex or thorny concepts in three sentences or less. 

This is an exercise in saying less.

# Article ideas

We can break these down into:

1. What is the goal and why do this
2. Compiling Previous
3. Getting NeXTSTEP up and functional
4. Getting the NFS up and running
5. Installing the NeXTSTEP Developer Environment
6. Compiling Python
7. Writing a script in Python 1.6

## Publishing plan

Let's get 2-3 assembled and then release.

This gives us enough scope to get a feel for the format and what works and what doesn't, and make sure that there's enough fuel in the tank to keep going.

Remember: 600-800 words. That's all. 

## Article structure

We'll break each article down into:

* Introduction
* Goal
* Trials and tribulations
* Summary of findings
* Things to explore further
